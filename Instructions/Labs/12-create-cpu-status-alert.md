# Create a CPU status alert for a SQL Server on Azure

**Estimated Time: 20 minutes**

You have been hired as a Senior Data Engineer to help automate day to day operations of database administration. This automation is to help ensure that the databases for AdventureWorks continue to operate at peak performance as well as provide methods for alerting based on certain criteria.

> &#128221; These exercises ask you to copy and paste T-SQL code and makes use of existing SQL resources. Please verify that the code has been copied correctly, before executing the code.

## Setup environment

If your lab virtual machine has been provided and pre-configured, you should find the lab files ready in the **C:\LabFiles** folder. *Take a moment to check, if the files are already there, skip this section*. However, if you're using your own machine or the lab files are missing, you'll need to clone them from *GitHub* to proceed.

1. From the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided, start a Visual Studio Code session.

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type **Git: Clone**. Select the **Git: Clone** option.

1. Paste the following URL into the **Repository URL** field and select **Enter**.

    ```url
    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-300-database-administrator.git
    ```

1. Save the repository to the **C:\LabFiles** folder on the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided (create the folder if it does not exist).

## Setup your SQL Server in Azure

Log in to Azure and check if you have an existing Azure SQL Server instance running in Azure. *Skip this section if you already have a SQL Server instance running in Azure*.

1. From the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided, start a Visual Studio Code session and navigate to the cloned repository from the previous section.

1. Right-click on the **/Allfiles/Labs** folder and select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1. Let's connect to Azure using the Azure CLI. Type the following command and select **Enter**.

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

    > &#128221; Note that a browser window will open. Use your Azure credentials to log in.

1. Once you are logged in to Azure, it's time to create a resource group if it doesn't already exist, and create a SQL server and database under that resource group. Type the following command and select **Enter**. *The script will take a few minutes to complete*.

    ```bash
    cd ./Setup
    ./deploy-sql-database.ps1
    ```

    > &#128221; Note that by default this script will create or a resource group called **contoso-rg**, or use a resource whose name start with *contoso-rg* if it exists. By default it will also create all resources on the **West US 2** region (westus2). Finally it will generate a random 12 character password for the **SQL admin password**. You can change these values by using one or more of the parameters **-rgName**, **-location** and **-sqlAdminPw** with your own values. The password will have to meet the Azure SQL password complexity requirements, at least 12 characters long, and contain at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character.

    > &#128221; Note that the script will add your current Public IP address to the SQL server firewall rules.

1. Once the script has completed, it will return the resource group name, SQL server name and database name, and admin user name and password. *Take note of these values as you will need them later in the lab*.

## Create an alert when a CPU exceeds an average of 80 percent

1. From the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided, start a browser session and navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). Connect to the Portal using your Azure credentials.

1. From the Azure Portal, in the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, type **SQL databases**, and select **SQL databases**. Select the **AdventureWorksLT** database name listed.

1. On the main blade for the **AdventureWorksLT** database, navigate down to the monitoring section. Select **Alerts**.

1. Select **Create alert rule**.

1. In the **Create an alert rule** page, select **CPU percentage**.

1. In the **Alert logic** section, select **Static** for the **Threshold type**. Then check that the **Aggregation** type is **Average** and that the **Value is** property is **Greater than**. Then in **Threshold** enter a value of **80**. Review the *Check every* and *lookback period* values.

1. Select **Next: Actions >**.

1. In the **Actions** tab, select **Create action group**.

1. On the **Action Group** screen, type **emailgroup** in the **Action group name** and **Display name** fields, and then select **Next: Notifications**.

1. On the **Notifications** tab, enter the following information:

    - **Notification type:** Email/SMS message/Push/Voice

        > &#128221;  When you select this option, a Email/SMS message/Push/Voice flyout will appear. Check the Email property and type the Azure username you signed in with. Select **OK**.

    - **Name:** DemoLab

1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

1. Back in the **Create an alert rule** page, select **Next: Details** and give the alert rule a unique name.

1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

1. With the alert in place, if the CPU usage on average exceeds 80%, an email is sent out.

## Cleanup Resources

If you are not using the Azure SQL Server for any other purpose, you can clean up the resources you created in this lab.

### Delete the Resource Group

If you created a new resource group for this lab, you can delete the resource group to remove all resources created in this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** from the left navigation pane or search for **Resource groups** in the search bar and select it from the results.

1. Go into the resource group that you created for this lab. The resource group will contain the Azure SQL Server and other resources created in this lab.

1. Select **Delete resource group** from the top menu.

1. In the **Delete resource group** dialog, type the name of the resource group to confirm and select **Delete**.

1. Wait for the resource group to be deleted.

1. Close the Azure portal.

### Delete the Lab resources only

If you didn't create a new resource group for this lab, and want to leave the resource group and its previous resources intact, you can still delete the resources created in this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** from the left navigation pane or search for **Resource groups** in the search bar and select it from the results.

1. Go into the resource group that you created for this lab. The resource group will contain the Azure SQL Server and other resources created in this lab.

1. Select all the resources prefixed with the SQL Server name you previously specified in the lab.

1. Select **Delete** from the top menu.

1. In the **Delete resources** dialog, type **delete** and select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** again to confirm the deletion of the resources.

1. Wait for the resources to be deleted.

1. Close the Azure portal.

You have successfully completed this lab.

Alerts can send you an email or call a web hook when some metric (for example database size or CPU usage) reaches a threshold you define. You've just seen how you can easily configure alerts for Azure SQL Databases.
