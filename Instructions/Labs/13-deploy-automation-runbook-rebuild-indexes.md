# Deploy an automation runbook to automatically rebuild indexes

**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

You have been hired as a Senior Database Administrator to help automate day to day operations of database administration. This automation is to help ensure that the databases for AdventureWorks continue to operate at peak performance as well as provide methods for alerting based on certain criteria. AdventureWorks utilizes SQL Server in both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings.

> &#128221; These exercises may ask you to copy and paste T-SQL code and makes use of existing SQL resources. Please verify that the code has been copied correctly, before executing the code.

## Setup environment

If your lab virtual machine has been provided and pre-configured, you should find the lab files ready in the **C:\LabFiles** folder. *Take a moment to check, if the files are already there, skip this section*. However, if you're using your own machine or the lab files are missing, you'll need to clone them from *GitHub* to proceed.

1. From the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided, start a Visual Studio Code session.

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type **Git: Clone**. Select the **Git: Clone** option.

1. Paste the following URL into the **Repository URL** field and select **Enter**.

    ```url
    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-300-database-administrator.git
    ```

1. Save the repository to the **C:\LabFiles** folder on the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided (create the folder if it does not exist).

## Setup your SQL Server in Azure

Log in to Azure and check if you have an existing Azure SQL Server instance running in Azure. *Skip this section if you already have a SQL Server instance running in Azure*.

1. From the lab virtual machine or your local machine if one wasn't provided, start a Visual Studio Code session and navigate to the cloned repository from the previous section.

1. Right-click on the **/Allfiles/Labs** folder and select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1. Let's connect to Azure using the Azure CLI. Type the following command and select **Enter**.

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

    > &#128221; Note that a browser window will open. Use your Azure credentials to log in.

1. Once you are logged in to Azure, it's time to create a resource group if it doesn't already exist, and create a SQL server and database under that resource group. Type the following command and select **Enter**. *The script will take a few minutes to complete*.

    ```bash
    cd ./Setup
    ./deploy-sql-database.ps1
    ```

    > &#128221; Note that by default this script will create or a resource group called **contoso-rg**, or use a resource whose name start with *contoso-rg* if it exists. By default it will also create all resources on the **West US 2** region (westus2). Finally it will generate a random 12 character password for the **SQL admin password**. You can change these values by using one or more of the parameters **-rgName**, **-location** and **-sqlAdminPw** with your own values. The password will have to meet the Azure SQL password complexity requirements, at least 12 characters long, and contain at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character.

    > &#128221; Note that the script will add your current Public IP address to the SQL server firewall rules.

1. Once the script has completed, it will return the resource group name, SQL server name and database name, and admin user name and password. *Take note of these values as you will need them later in the lab*.

    ```powershell
    $AzureSQLServerName = ''
    $DatabaseName = 'AdventureWorksLT'
    
    $Cred = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name "SQLUser"
    $SQLOutput = $(Invoke-Sqlcmd -ServerInstance $AzureSQLServerName -UserName $Cred.UserName -Password $Cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password -Database $DatabaseName -Query "EXEC dbo.usp_AdaptiveIndexDefrag" -Verbose) 4>&1

    Write-Output $SQLOutput
    ```

    > &#128221; Note that the code above is a PowerShell script that will execute the stored procedure **usp_AdaptiveIndexDefrag** on the **AdventureWorksLT** database. The script uses the **Invoke-Sqlcmd** cmdlet to connect to the SQL server and execute the stored procedure. The **Get-AutomationPSCredential** cmdlet is used to retrieve the credentials stored in the Automation account.

1. On the first line of the script paste in the server name you copied in the previous steps.

1. Select **Save**, and then select **Publish**.

1. Select **Yes** to confirm the publish action.

1. The *IndexMaintenance* runbook is now published.
